Change potatopic with plus sign, and brain chip textures.

Gameplay idea: Heal missing body parts or permanent wounds by reverting the age of the pawn
Down to a minimum of 18 years
The more 5-10 years that have been reverted, the more injuries get healed (maybe 2 per set of years?)
It should also increment the time to grow the clone

-------------------------------
TO-DO
Maybe some logs for the story? Tales and stuff for success and failures.

Maybe a raid of failed clones? They could really have some randomized gear, and could be a good way of getting random genes.
--------------------------------

transpile the birth year to not show it in AgetoolTipString for clones

transpile to avoid "assigned ideo to pawn with missing ideo"

prevent pawn death when removing vital organ somehow and discovery letters using the same method fwiw
