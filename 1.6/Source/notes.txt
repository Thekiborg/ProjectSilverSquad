Change potatopic with plus sign, and brain chip textures.

Gameplay idea: Heal missing body parts or permanent wounds by reverting the age of the pawn
Down to a minimum of 18 years
The more 5-10 years that have been reverted, the more injuries get healed (maybe 2 per set of years?)
It should also increment the time to grow the clone

-------------------------------
TO-DO
Do day calc and show it on the window

research def 
Craft chips at fab bench. Scan someone alive or dead and fresh with gizmo
Balance the material cost of everything.

Backstory: For both childhood and adulthood will be the same.
If failed clone set adult backstory to another one that makes them sadder
Clone. "I will never forget the muffled voices of the scientists outside the glass, and the taste of the paste" permanent -10 mood

Maybe some logs for the story? Tales and stuff for success and failures.

Maybe a raid of failed clones? They could really have some randomized gear, and could be a good way of getting random genes.
--------------------------------

transpile the birth year to not show it in AgetoolTipString for clones

transpile to avoid "assigned ideo to pawn with missing ideo"

prevent pawn death when removing vital organ somehow and discovery letters using the same method fwiw
