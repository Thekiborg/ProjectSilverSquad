Change potatopic with plus sign, and brain chip textures.

Gameplay idea: Heal missing body parts or permanent wounds by reverting the age of the pawn
Down to a minimum of 18 years
The more 5-10 years that have been reverted, the more injuries get healed (maybe 2 per set of years?)
It should also increment the time to grow the clone

transpile the birth year to not show it in AgetoolTipString for clones

transpile to avoid "assigned ideo to pawn with missing ideo"

for surgeries store the required products in a list excluding medicine

fix left arm surgeries removing right arm surgeries
fix scribing
